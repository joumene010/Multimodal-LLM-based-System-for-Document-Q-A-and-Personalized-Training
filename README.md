🧠 Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain
This project showcases a Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built with LangChain, enabling intelligent interaction with content-rich PDFs. It processes text, tables, and images, summarizes them using powerful AI models, and answers queries via a multi-modal interface.

💡 Skills Demonstrated
Document Parsing & Preprocessing
Extracting structured content from PDFs (text, tables, images).

Multi-Modal AI Integration
Combining NLP and image models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Groq) to handle different data types.

Prompt Engineering
Designing task-specific prompts for summarization and question answering.

LangChain Pipelines
Building and chaining custom LLM pipelines using LangChain's modular interface.

Vector Database Management
Indexing and linking summarized data with vector stores (Chroma, InMemoryStore).

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Building systems that retrieve relevant context to augment LLM-based responses.

Environment Configuration
Managing API keys and runtime settings securely using environment variables.

Modular Project Structuring
Cleanly separating concerns for extraction, summarization, storage, and retrieval.

🚀 Features
PDF Parsing: Extracts text, tables, and images using the unstructured library.

Summarization: Summarizes each modality with models from Groq, Hugging Face, or OpenAI.

Vectorstore: Stores summaries and links them to original sources.

Multi-Modal Retrieval: Retrieves relevant content across modalities to answer user queries.

Custom Models: Plug-and-play support for different LLMs or vision-language models.

📦 Installation Overview
Requires Python 3.8+

System dependencies: poppler, tesseract, libmagic

Python libraries: LangChain, Unstructured, ChromaDB, Hugging Face Transformers, etc.
