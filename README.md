# 🧠 Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain

This project showcases a **Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline built with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), enabling intelligent interaction with content-rich PDFs. It processes **text, tables, and images**, summarizes them using powerful AI models, and answers queries via a multi-modal interface.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated

- **Document Parsing & Preprocessing**  
  Extracting structured content from PDFs (text, tables, images).

- **Multi-Modal AI Integration**  
  Combining NLP and image models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Groq) to handle different data types.

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  Designing task-specific prompts for summarization and question answering.

- **LangChain Pipelines**  
  Building and chaining custom LLM pipelines using LangChain's modular interface.

- **Vector Database Management**  
  Indexing and linking summarized data with vector stores (`Chroma`, `InMemoryStore`).

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Building systems that retrieve relevant context to augment LLM-based responses.

- **Environment Configuration**  
  Managing API keys and runtime settings securely using environment variables.

- **Modular Project Structuring**  
  Cleanly separating concerns for extraction, summarization, storage, and retrieval.

## 🚀 Features

- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text, tables, and images using the `unstructured` library.  
- **Summarization**: Summarizes each modality with models from Groq, Hugging Face, or OpenAI.  
- **Vectorstore**: Stores summaries and links them to original sources.  
- **Multi-Modal Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant content across modalities to answer user queries.  
- **Custom Models**: Plug-and-play support for different LLMs or vision-language models.
